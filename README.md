### Requirements
Except for the source code,a significant folder named "res" should be placed with ".pro" file in parallel. This is because the ".pro" file contains the resources of the user interface. The file archihtecture is like the picture below.

### Start method
The "res"file already contains some demo videos to test, however, if you want to play your own videos, it is also OK. In either case, you will need to write the absolute path to the file in the command line argument, with double quotes surrounded. Like the picture below:

Then, just click the run button in QT to run.
